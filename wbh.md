## Info

N64 games go to SD:/wii64/roms

GameCube games go to SD:/games

- NOTE: They have to be in a certain structure

- e.g SD:/games/SSBB/game.iso

- e.g2 SD:/games/Mario Party 8/game.wbfs

- The folder name helps you define what the game is, it can be whatever

- The game HAS to be named "game.iso" or "game.wbfs", or "game.whatever the extension is"

Wii games go to SD:/wbfs

- Same as GameCube, but the "game" has to be named the GameID

- e.g SD:/wbfs/Mario Kart Wii/RMCP01.iso
