<details><summary><strong><font size="4">About the Pet</font></strong></summary>
  In Version 2.3.1, we received an update that included a Pet System, a little fluffy companion that you can take on your adventures.
  If you're a newcomer, you can receive your own Pet when you complete Story Quest 14.
  
  With a Pet at yor disposal, you can equip an aditional medal in the "Pet/Spirit Slot", and have Tricks that'll help you out, like Steal, which will increase the dropped amount of items when defeating an enemy.
  You can also name your pet, dress it up, and even combine different species to create abominations.
  
  To change your pets name, tap on the "Name" button.
  
  ### Equiping Another Medal
  When editing your keyblade, press the "Spirit" button at the top to add a 6th medal to your keyblade

  <img src="https://cache.sqex-bridge.jp/img/op6SNWDYc" />
  
  To dress up your pet, tap on the "Outfits" button.
  In here, you can customize your pet to whatever you want.

  To level up your pet, tap on the "Gear" button, and press "Optimize". Keep doing this everytime you get a new medal.
  Your Pet's rank is determined by the total points of the 6 Medals equipped on this screen. 
  When your Pet's rank increases, their damage multiplier (for your 6th slot Medal) will increase and they will also learn a new Trick!
  Medals that have traits give better points than ones without.

  Your Pet's Tricks will activate in battle after fulfilling certain conditions. These abilities are super helpful, as your Pet will come to your aid and help you in different ways! 
You can confirm your Pet's Tricks on the Main Pet Screen by tapping the Tricks button.

The Medals you use to increase your Pet's rank will not be deleted or used up, so feel free to change them up as you wish.
